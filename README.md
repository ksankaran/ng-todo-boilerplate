## Setup Steps

- `git clone https://github.com/ksankaran/ng-todo-boilerplate`
- `cd ng-todo-boilerplate`
- `npm install`

After installation, the build should generate the files needed to load the app.

## Start the test

Just run `npm run watch` to start the server (which opens the URL in browser) and watch
for file changes. Start your development and any changes to the file will trigger
the compilation to run again. Just refresh the browser to pickup the latest changes.

## Other commands

`npm run build:js` - Webpackify the bundle one time.
`npm run watch:css` - listen for scss changes and compile them.
